## Features

- **Multi-DEX Support**: Works with Raydium, Orca Whirlpools, and Meteora DEXs
- **Real-time Pool Monitoring**: Continuously scans for new liquidity pools
- **Advanced Arbitrage Detection**: Identifies profitable 1-hop and 2-hop arbitrage paths
- **Simulation Engine**: Tests potential trades before execution
- **Optimized Execution**: Prioritizes the most profitable opportunities
- **Performance Tracking**: Records all arbitrage attempts and results

## Supported DEXs

- Raydium (CLMM and standard pools)
- Orca Whirlpools
- Meteora

## Key Components

### Pool Discovery
```rust
pub async fn get_fresh_pools(tokens: Vec<TokenInArb>) -> HashMap<String, Market> {
    // Scans supported DEXs for new pools containing specified tokens
    // Implements rate limiting between requests
}

## Configuration

Edit `src/common/constants.rs` to configure:

- RPC endpoints
- DEX program IDs
- Rate limits
- Profit thresholds
- MongoDB connection settings


## Performance Optimization

The bot includes several optimization features:

- Batch processing with `get_multiple_accounts` for efficient RPC usage
- Market filtering based on liquidity thresholds
- Real-time WebSocket subscriptions for immediate market updates
- MongoDB for persistent storage and performance analysis
- Error rate limiting for problematic paths


## Monitoring

The bot outputs:

- Real-time progress bars
- Detailed logs of arbitrage opportunities with emoji indicators (ðŸ’¦, ðŸ‘€, ðŸ“Š)
- JSON files with trade results
- MongoDB integration for persistent storage and analysis
